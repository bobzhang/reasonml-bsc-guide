# ReasonML and BuckleScript

I'm making notes as I get ReasonML and BuckleScript working together. There's a lot to learn, and this is all new and exciting! I hope this helps you get started with a little less friction and a little more fun.

## What is ReasonML?

[Reason](https://facebook.github.io/reason/), or ReasonML, is a newcomer-friendly syntax to OCaml initiated by Facebook. It's also slated to become a package and build system that makes it easier to get started and keep code organized.

## What is BuckleScript?

[BuckleScript](http://bloomberg.github.io/bucklescript/), or `bsc` for short, is a relatively new Javascript backend to the OCaml compiler. In other words, you can use the functional, typed OCaml language to transpile to Javascript. The cool part is that BuckleScript is both readable (so if you're familiar with JS, it makes sense and is easier to debug), and it ties in to the `npm` package ecosystem. So you get the best of both worlds: a powerful, functional, typed language that ties in to the latest and greatest web development libraries.
